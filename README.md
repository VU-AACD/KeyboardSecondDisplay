# iPad Application in Swift with custom full screen keyboard and second display output

Created as part of Villanova's Augmented Alternative Communication Device (AACD) Senior Design Project
 
Application displays functional, custom full screen keyboard along with a message preview to the user while
simultaniously updating the ExternalView with a copy of the typed message that is displayed on an
external display. Designed around the need for a more natural method of communincation for those with limited
speech and motor functions. Intended use case involves the iPad user in a wheelchair with External Monitor viewable 
by someone standing across from them, able to read what the user is typing.

Additional Configuration must be made in XCode project settings, see included xcodeConfig.jpg

Uses some framework from https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftui-supporting-external-screens/
